This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render items with dynamic heights.  The issue arises because FlatList, by default, tries to optimize rendering by using a fixed height for each row. When the heights vary greatly, this leads to incorrect measurements and visual issues such as truncated content or overlapping items.

```javascript
// buggy code
<FlatList
  data={[{ height: 100 }, { height: 300 }, { height: 50 }]}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <View style={{ height: item.height, backgroundColor: 'lightblue' }}>
      <Text>{item.height}</Text>
    </View>
  )}
/>
```
